# AI-Phone-Year

A public journey to become an ML/AI-ready engineer using only a smartphone.

## Why this exists
I don’t have a laptop until August 2026.
Instead of waiting, I’m building strong math, ML, and AI foundations in public.

## Constraints
- Mobile-only learning
- 2–2.5 hours/day
- No heavy compute until Aug 2026

## Roadmap (High-level)
- Math Foundations ✅
- From-Zero Python (next)
- Python Core
- Statistics & Probability
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- LLMs & AI Systems (theory)
- Quantum Computing (intro)

## Proof Rules
- Build from scratch before using libraries
- No blind tutorial copy-paste
- Reproducibility over hype
- All progress is public

## Current Status
Math phase completed. Starting From-Zero Python mini-boot.
